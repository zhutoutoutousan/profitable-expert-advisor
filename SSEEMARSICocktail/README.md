SSE Index Multi-Timeframe RSI Momentum Strategy with EMA Distance Trading
Strategy Overview:
This advanced momentum-based trading system is specifically designed for the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Index, capturing RSI bounce opportunities across multiple timeframes while incorporating sophisticated EMA distance-based entries. The strategy combines traditional RSI oversold/overbought analysis with modern volatility-adjusted position management.
Core Trading Logic:

Weekly RSI Signals: Large position entries (10% equity) when weekly RSI crosses above 30 after being oversold, targeting major trend reversals
Daily RSI Signals: Medium position entries (5% equity) when daily RSI crosses above 30, capturing short-term momentum shifts
EMA Distance Entries: Strategic entries (7.5% equity) when price extends 50+ pips from 200 EMA while remaining above it, exploiting mean reversion opportunities

Risk Management System:

Partial Profit Taking: Both RSI positions scale out 25% when daily RSI becomes overbought (>70), allowing multiple profit captures
Complete Weekly Exits: All weekly positions close when weekly RSI becomes overbought, ensuring trend-following discipline
EMA Crossover Exits: EMA distance trades exit cleanly when price crosses below 50 EMA, providing responsive trend change detection
Emergency Exit: Master exit when EMA crosses above price, protecting all positions during major trend reversals

Advanced Features:

Concurrent Position Management: Up to 100 pyramiding positions across three distinct entry strategies
Multi-Timeframe Analysis: Seamlessly integrates weekly and daily RSI data regardless of chart timeframe
Real-Time Monitoring: Comprehensive information table displaying RSI levels, EMA distances, position quantities, and trade counts
Visual Feedback System: Color-coded entry/exit signals with background highlighting for immediate market condition recognition

Ideal Market Conditions:
Optimized for volatile, emotion-driven markets like Chinese equities where RSI bounces from oversold levels frequently create profitable momentum shifts. The strategy's multiple entry mechanisms ensure comprehensive market coverage while sophisticated exit rules protect capital during adverse conditions.
Technical Requirements:

Recommended for SSE Composite Index, SSE 50, or related Chinese equity ETFs
Best performance on daily charts with sufficient historical data
Suitable for accounts with minimum $10,000 capital for effective position sizing

This strategy represents a complete trading system combining technical analysis fundamentals with modern risk management principles, specifically calibrated for the unique characteristics of Chinese equity markets.
